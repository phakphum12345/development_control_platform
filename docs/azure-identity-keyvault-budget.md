# Azure identity, Key Vault, and budget reader

This adapter set is read-only. It obtains Microsoft Entra access tokens through a platform-provided Managed Identity endpoint, reads named Key Vault secrets, and reads an existing Azure Consumption budget. It does not create a vault, role assignment, budget, subscription, resource group, or compute resource.

## Required deployment configuration
- Configure a system- or user-assigned Managed Identity on the gateway host.
- Grant only Key Vault Secrets User on the specific vault and read-only Cost Management/Budget permissions at the narrowest applicable scope.
- Configure DCP_AZURE_USE_IMDS=true only on an Azure VM that exposes IMDS, or use the platform-provided local IDENTITY_ENDPOINT and IDENTITY_HEADER.
- Set the Key Vault origin and secret names through deployment configuration. Never put secret values in GitHub Actions variables, source files, command lines, or logs.
- Provide subscription ID and an already-existing budget name. This code intentionally contains no create/update/delete budget operation.
- Set `DCP_AZURE_PROJECTED_RUN_COST_USD` to an explicit positive per-run estimate for the configured maximum runtime; zero or missing estimates block provisioning.

## Budget semantics
A budget read must return an active time period, Cost category, amount, currentSpend, matching forecastSpend and currency. Missing or malformed budget data fails closed. The adapter only compares USD amounts; other currencies are denied until a reviewed conversion policy exists. Azure budgets are monitoring/alerting constructs, so the gateway's independent spend circuit breaker remains mandatory.

## Verification boundary
Tests use mocked HTTP responses only. No Azure endpoint was contacted, no identity token was requested from a live host, and no billable Azure resource was created. Required role assignments and live authorization are deployment-time checks and remain unverified here.


## Projection and freshness safety

The Azure budget reader now requires a valid forecast amount with the same currency
as current spend. A missing or malformed forecast is UNKNOWN and blocks
provisioning; a currency mismatch is not treated as a comparable value.
Budget snapshots reject negative, NaN, infinite, or malformed amounts.

`DCP_AZURE_PROJECTED_RUN_COST_USD` is the conservative projected cost for one
runner at its configured maximum runtime. The guard evaluates
`projected_run_cost_usd * (active_runner_count + 1)`, so existing active and
cleanup-pending runners are included before authorizing another runner. Failed
records with provider resources still pending cleanup continue to count against
concurrency.

The Gateway status response includes only aggregate lifecycle counters
(`state_counts`, `cleanup_pending`, `cleanup_retries`, and
`cleanup_confirmed`); it does not disclose runner names, repository IDs, or
provider identifiers.

All Azure ARM, Key Vault, GitHub App, and Orka bearer credentials are placed in
non-redirected request headers. A redirect cannot forward these credentials to
a different host. Provider creation requires both a live budget guard and
verified cleanup wiring. The production bootstrap remains disabled until all
deployment-side controls are configured and accepted.


The Gateway serializes capacity checks and durable provisioning reservations in
one process so concurrent requests cannot all observe the same free slot. The
current SQLite deployment supports one Gateway process; multi-process or
multi-region provisioning requires a shared transactional reservation/nonce
store before scaling out.

The Azure Consumption budget is authoritative only for Azure resources. Orka
macOS remains disabled until its own provider-specific cost/budget guard is
implemented and verified; an Azure budget PASS must never be treated as proof
that MacStadium spend is within limits.


Azure's Consumption Budgets API only returns `forecastSpend` when the budget
contains a forecast alert type. Configure a forecasted notification on the
target budget; otherwise DCP treats the snapshot as UNKNOWN and denies runner
creation rather than silently falling back to current spend only.
