# DCP Infrastructure Manager — Phase 1

## Scope

This increment introduces a DCP-owned, provider-neutral infrastructure inventory and lifecycle contract. It is deliberately local-first. The initial `FakeInfrastructureProvider` is a deterministic simulation and does not create VMs, containers, cloud resources, or paid capacity.

## Components

- `InfrastructureManager`: validates image/template compatibility, provider readiness, idempotency, and lifecycle operations.
- `InfrastructureStore`: durable SQLite inventory and credential-free lifecycle audit events.
- `InfrastructureProvider`: provider-neutral readiness/create/inspect/start/stop/delete contract.
- `FakeInfrastructureProvider`: simulation implementation for development and tests.
- Image catalog: pinned logical DCP image identifiers for Linux, Windows, and macOS.
- Template catalog: bounded CPU, memory, disk metadata for each target OS.

## Lifecycle

`provisioned -> running -> stopped -> running -> deleted`

Invalid transitions fail with a lifecycle conflict. Delete is idempotent. Resource creation is idempotent by caller-supplied key; reusing a key for a different OS/image/template is rejected.

## Safety

- External providers are disabled unless `provisioning_enabled=True` is explicitly supplied by a future composition layer.
- Fake provider is the only default provider and performs no external I/O.
- No Azure, Orka, Hyper-V, Apple host, network, or cloud SDK is called.
- No provider credentials or secrets are stored in the inventory.
- macOS image metadata is catalog metadata only; it is not evidence of macOS host availability or build readiness.
- This phase does not expose unauthenticated HTTP lifecycle endpoints or enable the existing Gateway provisioning route.

## Validation

Run:

```sh
python -m unittest tests.test_cloud_gateway_infrastructure -v
```

The tests use temporary SQLite databases and the fake provider only. Live infrastructure acceptance remains a separate, explicitly approved phase.


## Authenticated Gateway API — Phase 2

The Gateway composes a persistent `InfrastructureManager` using
`DCP_GATEWAY_INFRA_DATABASE` (defaults to the gateway database path plus
`.infra`) and registers only the `fake` provider. The composition hard-codes
`provisioning_enabled=False`; it is not enabled by an environment variable.

All browser endpoints require a trusted proxy identity. Mutating requests also
require the configured exact same-origin and server-issued CSRF token.

| Method | Route | Permission | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/infrastructure?view=catalog` | owner/operator | Provider, image and template catalog |
| GET | `/api/infrastructure` | owner/operator | Resource inventory |
| GET | `/api/infrastructure/{uuid}` | owner/operator | Inspect one resource |
| GET | `/api/infrastructure/{uuid}/events` | owner/operator | Lifecycle audit |
| POST | `/api/infrastructure` | owner/operator | Create fake resource; requires Idempotency-Key |
| POST | `/api/infrastructure/{uuid}/start` | owner/operator | Start simulation |
| POST | `/api/infrastructure/{uuid}/stop` | owner/operator | Stop simulation |
| POST | `/api/infrastructure/{uuid}/restart` | owner/operator | Restart simulation |
| DELETE | `/api/infrastructure/{uuid}` | owner | Delete simulation |

The dashboard's Infrastructure Manager view talks only to the same-origin
Gateway API. It does not hold Gateway credentials or call provider SDKs.
GitHub Pages/static-only deployments cannot perform these operations without
the trusted authenticated API backend.

## Validation

```sh
python -m unittest tests.test_cloud_gateway_infrastructure -v
python -m unittest tests.test_cloud_gateway_infrastructure_api -v
```

The API tests sign local proxy assertions and run against an ephemeral loopback
HTTP server with temporary SQLite files. They exercise owner/operator access
and the fake provider only.
